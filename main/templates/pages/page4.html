                    Healthy students perform well in their academics. We at NPUSPTA understand the importance of
                    wellbeing
                    of our member
                    students. Students are vulnerable and sensitive to many diseases and since they are in classroom
                    together with many
                    more pupils, risk of spreading the infections are very high. Complete closure of schools and
                    colleges
                    during
                    COVID-19 pandemic is an eye opener for everyone to witness how students are vulnerable.

                <p class="card-text">
                    Apart from this student are also subjected to risk of accidents and injuries. Almost all students
                    use
                    some means of
                    transportation to commute between school and home and frequency of accidents in our transportation
                    system is quite
                    high.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Also, many students are passionate about sports and games and are actively participating and
                    training
                    every day. It
                    is very common to have injuries and not only frequency of injuries is regular but intensity of some
                    sports injuries
                    is also high.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                    Considering all these vulnerabilities and risks students carry we at NPUSPTA are providing them with
                    Health and
                    Insurance cover for free. Although we are strongly advocating for student safety at school premises
                    but
                    unable to
                    prevent any health and injuries risks student may exposed to. So, through this initiative we are
                    trying
                    at least to
                    mitigate any financial burden on parents arising from treatment and medical expenses of the student.
